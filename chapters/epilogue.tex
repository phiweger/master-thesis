\section{Epilogue}

\begin{quotation}
    \emph{What about the future? It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out we are going to get more infections in the future. This is really obvious. Animals carry an enormous number of pathogens that can jump into humans. The way we live today - we have cut down forests, we have changed farming, big cities, international travel - they just fuel the engine of viral emergence and evolution. How do we prevent this? [...] Some people say: Well, let's try and predict what is going to emerge. Let me tell you, just - forget that. Ok? [...] You can't predict what is going to emerge. [...] And I also don't think that just going out into nature and surveilling things is going to be the answer, because there are millions of things out there. Response is better than prediction. [...] And we have the tools: What's called metagenomics [...] can save the planet. -- \hyperlink{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK8ekVy_rmQ}{E. Holmes}}
