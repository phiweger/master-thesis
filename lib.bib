                 phenotypic properties, the development of a robust framework

  abstract    = "1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and
                 prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to
                 express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities
                 and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to
                 boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting
                 statistical models that differs fundamentally from
                 conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious
                 model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two
                 algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to
                 their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an
                 adaptive method for combining many simple models to give
                 improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be
                 understood as an additive regression model in which individual
                 terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise
                 fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important
                 advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of
                 predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have
                 no need for prior data transformation or elimination of
                 outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and
                 automatically handle interaction effects between predictors.
                 Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback
                 of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive
                 performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be
                 summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and
                 their predictive performance is superior to most traditional
                 modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a
                 number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate
                 the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a
                 distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla
                 australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New
                 Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate
                 effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a
                 model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a
                 tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.",

                 have resulted in a multitude of different algorithms for
                 solving a broad range of problems. To tackle a new
                 application, a researcher typically tries to map their problem
                 onto one of these existing methods, often influenced by their
                 familiarity with specific algorithms and by the availability
                 of corresponding software implementations. In this study, we
                 describe an alternative methodology for applying machine
                 learning, in which a bespoke solution is formulated for each
                 new application. The solution is expressed through a compact
                 modelling language, and the corresponding custom machine
                 learning code is then generated automatically. This
                 model-based approach offers several major advantages,
                 including the opportunity to create highly tailored models for
                 specific scenarios, as well as rapid prototyping and
                 comparison of a range of alternative models. Furthermore,
                 newcomers to the field of machine learning do not have to
                 learn about the huge range of traditional methods, but instead
                 can focus their attention on understanding a single modelling
                 environment. In this study, we show how probabilistic
                 graphical models, coupled with efficient inference algorithms,
                 provide a very flexible foundation for model-based machine
                 learning, and we outline a large-scale commercial application
                 of this framework involving tens of millions of users. We also
                 describe the concept of probabilistic programming as a
                 powerful software environment for model-based machine
                 learning, and we discuss a specific probabilistic programming

                   programming language. Edward defines two compositional
                   representations---random variables and inference. By
                   treating inference as a first class citizen, on a par with
                   modeling, we show that probabilistic programming can be as
                   flexible and computationally efficient as traditional deep
                   learning. For flexibility, Edward makes it easy to fit the
                   same model using a variety of composable inference methods,
                   ranging from point estimation to variational inference to
                   MCMC. In addition, Edward can reuse the modeling
                   representation as part of inference, facilitating the design
                   of rich variational models and generative adversarial
                   networks. For efficiency, Edward is integrated into
                   TensorFlow, providing significant speedups over existing

               ago. Small is Beautiful looks at the economic structure of the
               Western world in a revolutionary way. Schumacher maintains that
               Man's current pursuit of profit and progress, which promotes
               giant organisations and increased specialisation, has in fact
               resulted in gross economic inefficiency, environmental pollution
               and inhumane working conditions. Schumacher challenges the
               doctrine of economic, technological and scientific
               specialisation and proposes a system of IntermediateTechnology,
               based on smaller working units, communal ownership and regional
               workplaces utilising local labour and resources.",

              strategies to construct PV variants containing synthetic
              replacements of the capsid coding sequences either by
              deoptimizing synonymous codon usage (PV-AB) or by maximizing
              synonymous codon position changes of the existing wild-type (wt)
              poliovirus codons (PV-SD). Despite 934 nucleotide changes in the
              capsid coding region, PV-SD RNA produced virus with wild-type
              characteristics. In contrast, no viable virus was recovered from
              PV-AB RNA carrying 680 silent mutations, due to a reduction of
              genome translation and replication below a critical level. After
              subcloning of smaller portions of the AB capsid coding sequence
              into the wt background, several viable viruses were obtained with
              a wide range of phenotypes corresponding to their efficiency of
              directing genome translation. Surprisingly, when inoculated with
              equal infectious doses (PFU), even the most replication-deficient
              viruses appeared to be as pathogenic in PV-sensitive CD155tg

              equal amounts of virus particles revealed a neuroattenuated
              phenotype over 100-fold. Direct analysis indicated a striking
              reduction of the specific infectivity of PV-AB-type virus
              particles. Due to the distribution effect of many silent
              mutations over large genome segments, codon-deoptimized viruses
              should have genetically stable phenotypes, and they may prove
              suitable as attenuated substrates for the production of

  abstract  = "Motivation: We present a new feature of the MAFFT multiple
               alignment program for suppressing over-alignment (aligning
               unrelated segments). Conventional MAFFT is highly sensitive in
               aligning conserved regions in remote homologs, but the risk of
               over-alignment is recently becoming greater, as low-quality or
               noisy sequences are increasing in protein sequence databases,
               due, for example, to sequencing errors and difficulty in gene
               prediction.Results: The proposed method utilizes a variable
               scoring matrix for different pairs of sequences (or groups) in a
               single multiple sequence alignment, based on the global
               similarity of each pair. This method significantly increases the
               correctly gapped sites in real examples and in simulations under
               various conditions. Regarding sensitivity, the effect of the
               proposed method is slightly negative in real protein-based
               benchmarks, and mostly neutral in simulation-based benchmarks.
               This approach is based on natural biological reasoning and
               should be compatible with many methods based on dynamic
               programming for multiple sequence alignment.Availability and
               implementation: The new feature is available in MAFFT versions

                 developed. The CPU time is drastically reduced as compared
                 with existing methods. MAFFT includes two novel techniques.
                 (i) Homo logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast
                 Fourier transform (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is
                 converted to a sequence composed of volume and polarity values
                 of each amino acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified
                 scoring system that performs well for reducing CPU time and
                 increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences
                 having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly
                 related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics,
                 the progressive method (FFT-NS-2) and the iterative refinement

  abstract    = "Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of emergence and
                 circulation of new human seasonal influenza virus variants is
                 a key scientific and public health challenge. The global
                 circulation patterns of influenza A/H3N2 viruses are well
                 characterized, but the patterns of A/H1N1 and B viruses have
                 remained largely unexplored. Here we show that the global
                 circulation patterns of A/H1N1 (up to 2009), B/Victoria, and
                 B/Yamagata viruses differ substantially from those of A/H3N2
                 viruses, on the basis of analyses of 9,604 haemagglutinin
                 sequences of human seasonal influenza viruses from 2000 to
                 2012. Whereas genetic variants of A/H3N2 viruses did not
                 persist locally between epidemics and were reseeded from East
                 and Southeast Asia, genetic variants of A/H1N1 and B viruses
                 persisted across several seasons and exhibited complex global
                 dynamics with East and Southeast Asia playing a limited role
                 in disseminating new variants. The less frequent global
                 movement of influenza A/H1N1 and B viruses coincided with
                 slower rates of antigenic evolution, lower ages of infection,
                 and smaller, less frequent epidemics compared to A/H3N2
                 viruses. Detailed epidemic models support differences in age
                 of infection, combined with the less frequent travel of
                 children, as probable drivers of the differences in the
                 patterns of global circulation, suggesting a complex

                 pose a grave threat to human health. However, the factors that
                 mediate the emergence of RNA viruses such as influenza A virus
                 (IAV) are still incompletely understood. Phylogenetic
                 inference is crucial to reconstructing the origins and tracing
                 the flow of IAV within and between hosts. Here we show that
                 explicitly allowing IAV host lineages to have independent
                 rates of molecular evolution is necessary for reliable
                 phylogenetic inference of IAV and that methods that do not do
                 so, including 'relaxed' molecular clock models, can be
                 positively misleading. A phylogenomic analysis using a
                 host-specific local clock model recovers extremely consistent
                 evolutionary histories across all genomic segments and
                 demonstrates that the equine H7N7 lineage is a sister clade to
                 strains from birds--as well as those from humans, swine and
                 the equine H3N8 lineage--sharing an ancestor with them in the
                 mid to late 1800s. Moreover, major western and eastern
                 hemisphere avian influenza lineages inferred for each gene
                 coalesce in the late 1800s. On the basis of these phylogenies
                 and the synchrony of these key nodes, we infer that the
                 internal genes of avian influenza virus (AIV) underwent a
                 global selective sweep beginning in the late 1800s, a process
                 that continued throughout the twentieth century and up to the
                 present. The resulting western hemispheric AIV lineage
                 subsequently contributed most of the genomic segments to the
                 1918 pandemic virus and, independently, the 1963 equine H3N8
                 panzootic lineage. This approach provides a clear resolution
                 of evolutionary patterns and processes in IAV, including the

                 Similarly, how genomic processes relate to global influenza
                 epidemiology, in which the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes

                 populations in both hemispheres, we show that the genomic

  abstract    = "UNLABELLED: Influenza viral infection represents a serious
                 public health problem that causes contagious respiratory
                 disease, which is most effectively prevented through
                 vaccination to reduce transmission and future infection. The
                 nonstructural (NS) gene of influenza A virus encodes an mRNA
                 transcript that is alternatively spliced to express two viral
                 proteins, the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and the nuclear
                 export protein (NEP). The importance of the NS gene of
                 influenza A virus for viral replication and virulence has been
                 well described and represents an attractive target to generate
                 live attenuated influenza viruses with vaccine potential.
                 Considering that most amino acids can be synthesized from
                 several synonymous codons, this study employed the use of
                 misrepresented mammalian codons (codon deoptimization) for the
                 de novo synthesis of a viral NS RNA segment based on influenza
                 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8) virus. We generated three
                 different recombinant influenza PR8 viruses containing
                 codon-deoptimized synonymous mutations in coding regions
                 comprising the entire NS gene or the mRNA corresponding to the
                 individual viral protein NS1 or NEP, without modifying the
                 respective splicing and packaging signals of the viral
                 segment. The fitness of these synthetic viruses was attenuated
                 in vivo, while they retained immunogenicity, conferring both
                 homologous and heterologous protection against influenza A
                 virus challenges. These results indicate that influenza
                 viruses can be effectively attenuated by synonymous codon
                 deoptimization of the NS gene and open the possibility of
                 their use as a safe vaccine to prevent infections with these
                 important human pathogens. IMPORTANCE: Vaccination serves as
                 the best therapeutic option to protect humans against
                 influenza viral infections. However, the efficacy of current
                 influenza vaccines is suboptimal, and novel approaches are
                 necessary for the prevention of disease cause by this
                 important human respiratory pathogen. The nonstructural (NS)
                 gene of influenza virus encodes both the multifunctional
                 nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), essential for innate immune
                 evasion, and the nuclear export protein (NEP), required for
                 the nuclear export of viral ribonucleoproteins and for timing
                 of the virus life cycle. Here, we have generated a recombinant
                 influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8) virus containing a
                 codon-deoptimized NS segment that is attenuated in vivo yet
                 retains immunogenicity and protection efficacy against
                 homologous and heterologous influenza virus challenges. These
                 results open the exciting possibility of using this NS codon
                 deoptimization methodology alone or in combination with other
                 approaches for the future development of vaccine candidates to
                 prevent influenza viral infections.",

                 amino acids (Met and Trp), all other amino acid residues are
                 each encoded by multiple, so-called synonymous codons.
                 Synonymous codons were initially presumed to have entirely
                 equivalent functions, however, the finding that synonymous
                 codons are not present at equal frequencies in genes/genomes
                 suggested that codon choice might have functional implications
                 beyond amino acid coding. The pattern of non-uniform codon use
                 (known as codon usage bias) varies between organisms and
                 represents a unique feature of an organism. Organism-specific
                 codon choice is related to organism-specific differences in
                 populations of cognate tRNAs. This implies that, in a given
                 organism, frequently used codons will be translated more
                 rapidly than infrequently used ones and vice versa A theory of
                 codon-tRNA co-evolution (necessary to balance accurate and
                 efficient protein production) was put forward to explain the
                 existence of codon usage bias. This model suggests that
                 selection favours preferred (frequent) over un-preferred
                 (rare) codons in order to sustain efficient protein production
                 in cells and that a given un-preferred codon will have the
                 same effect on an organism's fitness regardless of its
                 position within an mRNA's open reading frame. However, many
                 recent studies refute this prediction. Un-preferred codons
                 have been found to have important functional roles and their
                 effects appeared to be position-dependent. Synonymous codon
                 usage affects the efficiency/stringency of mRNA decoding, mRNA
                 biogenesis/stability, and protein secretion and folding. This

  abstract    = "Viruses use the cellular machinery of their hosts for
                 replication. It has therefore been proposed that the
                 nucleotide and dinucleotide compositions of viruses should
                 match those of their host species. If this is upheld, it may
                 then be possible to use dinucleotide composition to predict
                 the true host species of viruses sampled in metagenomic
                 surveys. However, it is also clear that different taxonomic
                 groups of viruses tend to have distinctive patterns of
                 dinucleotide composition that may be independent of host
                 species. To determine the relative strength of the effect of
                 host versus virus family in shaping dinucleotide composition,
                 we performed a comparative analysis of 20 RNA virus families
                 from 15 host groupings, spanning two animal phyla and more
                 than 900 virus species. In particular, we determined the odds
                 ratios for the 16 possible dinucleotides and performed a
                 discriminant analysis to evaluate the capability of virus
                 dinucleotide composition to predict the correct virus family
                 or host taxon from which it was isolated. Notably, while 81\%
                 of the data analyzed here were predicted to the correct virus
                 family, only 62\% of these data were predicted to their
                 correct subphylum/class host and a mere 32\% to their correct
                 mammalian order. Similarly, dinucleotide composition has a
                 weak predictive power for different hosts within individual
                 virus families. We therefore conclude that dinucleotide
                 composition is generally uniform within a virus family but
                 less well reflects that of its host species. This has obvious
                 implications for attempts to accurately predict host species
                 from virus genome sequences alone.IMPORTANCE Determining the
                 processes that shape virus genomes is central to understanding
                 virus evolution and emergence. One question of particular
                 importance is why nucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies
                 differ so markedly between viruses. In particular, it is
                 currently unclear whether host species or virus family has the
                 biggest impact on dinucleotide frequencies and whether
                 dinucleotide composition can be used to accurately predict
                 host species. Using a comparative analysis, we show that
                 dinucleotide composition has a strong phylogenetic association
                 across different RNA virus families, such that dinucleotide

                 species. Although functionally uncharacterized, robust virus
                 attenuation was achieved by recoding of viral proteins using
                 underrepresented codon pairs. Because viruses replicate
                 exclusively inside living cells, we posited that their codon
                 pair preferences reflect those of their host(s). Analysis of
                 many human viruses showed, however, that the encoding of
                 viruses is influenced only marginally by host codon pair
                 preferences. Furthermore, examination of codon pair
                 preferences of vertebrate, insect, and arthropod-borne viruses
                 revealed that the latter do not utilize codon pairs
                 overrepresented in arthropods more frequently than other
                 viruses. We found, however, that codon pair bias is a direct

                 proteins and that virus attenuation by codon pair

  abstract    = "Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are important causes of
                 human disease nearly worldwide. All arboviruses circulate
                 among wild animals, and many cause disease after spillover
                 transmission to humans and agriculturally important domestic
                 animals that are incidental or dead-end hosts. Viruses such as
                 dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) that have lost the
                 requirement for enzootic amplification now produce extensive
                 epidemics in tropical urban centers. Many arboviruses recently
                 have increased in importance as human and veterinary pathogens
                 using a variety of mechanisms. Beginning in 1999, West Nile
                 virus (WNV) underwent a dramatic geographic expansion into the
                 Americas. High amplification associated with avian virulence
                 coupled with adaptation for replication at higher temperatures
                 in mosquito vectors, has caused the largest epidemic of
                 arboviral encephalitis ever reported in the Americas. Japanese
                 encephalitis virus (JEV), the most frequent arboviral cause of
                 encephalitis worldwide, has spread throughout most of Asia and
                 as far south as Australia from its putative origin in
                 Indonesia and Malaysia. JEV has caused major epidemics as it
                 invaded new areas, often enabled by rice culture and
                 amplification in domesticated swine. Rift Valley fever virus
                 (RVFV), another arbovirus that infects humans after
                 amplification in domesticated animals, undergoes epizootic
                 transmission during wet years following droughts. Warming of
                 the Indian Ocean, linked to the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern
                 Oscillation in the Pacific, leads to heavy rainfall in east
                 Africa inundating surface pools and vertically infected
                 mosquito eggs laid during previous seasons. Like WNV, JEV and
                 RVFV could become epizootic and epidemic in the Americas if
                 introduced unintentionally via commerce or intentionally for
                 nefarious purposes. Climate warming also could facilitate the
                 expansion of the distributions of many arboviruses, as
                 documented for bluetongue viruses (BTV), major pathogens of
                 ruminants. BTV, especially BTV-8, invaded Europe after climate
                 warming and enabled the major midge vector to expand is
                 distribution northward into southern Europe, extending the
                 transmission season and vectorial capacity of local midge
                 species. Perhaps the greatest health risk of arboviral
                 emergence comes from extensive tropical urbanization and the
                 colonization of this expanding habitat by the highly
                 anthropophilic (attracted to humans) mosquito, Aedes aegypti.
                 These factors led to the emergence of permanent endemic cycles

                 arbovirus transmission, adequate human viremia and vector
                 competence of Ae. aegypti and/or Ae. albopictus, may be met by
                 two other viruses with the potential to become major human

                 CHIKV that produces a comparably debilitating arthralgic
                 disease in South America. Further research is needed to
                 understand the potential of these and other arboviruses to

               viral evolution is especially topical given the growing
               awareness that emerging and re-emerging diseases (most of which
               are caused by RNA viruses) represent a major threat to public
               health. However, while the study of viral evolution has
               developed rapidly in the last 30 years, relatively little
               attention has been directed toward linking work on the
               mechanisms of viral evolution within cells or individual hosts,
               to the epidemiological outcomes of these processes. This novel

               temporal scales. The Evolution and Emergence of RNA Viruses
               provides a comprehensive overview of RNA virus evolution, with a

               the first book to link mechanisms of viral evolution with

  abstract    = "The 2013-2016 West African epidemic caused by the Ebola virus
                 was of unprecedented magnitude, duration and impact. Here we
                 reconstruct the dispersal, proliferation and decline of Ebola
                 virus throughout the region by analysing 1,610 Ebola virus
                 genomes, which represent over 5\% of the known cases. We test
                 the association of geography, climate and demography with
                 viral movement among administrative regions, inferring a
                 classic 'gravity' model, with intense dispersal between larger
                 and closer populations. Despite attenuation of international
                 dispersal after border closures, cross-border transmission had
                 already sown the seeds for an international epidemic,
                 rendering these measures ineffective at curbing the epidemic.
                 We address why the epidemic did not spread into neighbouring
                 countries, showing that these countries were susceptible to
                 substantial outbreaks but at lower risk of introductions.
                 Finally, we reveal that this large epidemic was a
                 heterogeneous and spatially dissociated collection of
                 transmission clusters of varying size, duration and
                 connectivity. These insights will help to inform interventions
                 in future epidemics.",

                 and ecological factors, but no comparative study has
                 explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global
                 temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a
                 database of 335 EID 'events' (origins of EIDs) between 1940
                 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID
                 events have risen significantly over time after controlling
                 for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s)
                 concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by
                 zoonoses (60.3\% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8\%)
                 originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory
                 virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over
                 time. We find that 54.3\% of EID events are caused by bacteria
                 or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drug-resistant
                 microbes in our database. Our results confirm that EID origins
                 are significantly correlated with socio-economic,
                 environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for
                 identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to
                 originate (emerging disease 'hotspots'). They also reveal a
                 substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs
                 originating at lower latitudes where reporting effort is low.
                 We conclude that global resources to counter disease emergence
                 are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and
                 surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next

  abstract    = "UNLABELLED: Seasonal influenza epidemics and occasional
                 pandemics threaten public health worldwide. New alternative
                 strategies for generating recombinant viruses with vaccine
                 potential are needed. Interestingly, influenza viruses
                 circulating in different hosts have been found to have
                 distinct codon usage patterns, which may reflect host
                 adaptation. We therefore hypothesized that it is possible to
                 make a human seasonal influenza virus that is specifically
                 attenuated in human cells but not in eggs by converting its
                 codon usage so that it is similar to that observed from avian
                 influenza viruses. This approach might help to generate human
                 live attenuated viruses without affecting their yield in eggs.
                 To test this hypothesis, over 300 silent mutations were
                 introduced into the genome of a seasonal H1N1 influenza virus.
                 The resultant mutant was significantly attenuated in mammalian
                 cells and mice, yet it grew well in embryonated eggs. A single
                 dose of intranasal vaccination induced potent innate, humoral,
                 and cellular immune responses, and the mutant could protect
                 mice against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. The
                 attenuated mutant could also be used as a vaccine master donor
                 strain by introducing hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes
                 derived from other strains. Thus, our approach is a successful
                 strategy to generate attenuated viruses for future application
                 as vaccines. IMPORTANCE: Vaccination has been one of the best
                 protective measures in combating influenza virus infection.
                 Current licensed influenza vaccines and their production have
                 various limitations. Our virus attenuation strategy makes use
                 of the codon usage biases of human and avian influenza viruses
                 to generate a human-derived influenza virus that is attenuated
                 in mammalian hosts. This method, however, does not affect
                 virus replication in eggs. This makes the resultant mutants
                 highly compatible with existing egg-based vaccine production
                 pipelines. The viral proteins generated from the codon bias
                 mutants are identical to the wild-type viral proteins. In
                 addition, our massive genome-wide mutational approach further
                 minimizes the concern over reverse mutations. The potential
                 use of this kind of codon bias mutant as a master donor strain
                 to generate other live attenuated viruses is also
                 demonstrated. These findings put forward a promising live
                 attenuated influenza vaccine generation strategy to control

                 cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and was responsible
                 for 3 pandemics in the 20th century. As the replication of the
                 influenza virus is based on its host's machinery, codon usage
                 of its viral genes might be subject to host selection
                 pressures, especially after interspecies transmission. A
                 better understanding of viral evolution and host adaptive
                 responses might help control this disease. RESULTS: Relative
                 Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) values of the genes from segment
                 1 to segment 6 of avian and human influenza viruses, including
                 pandemic H1N1, were studied via Correspondence Analysis (CA).
                 The codon usage patterns of seasonal human influenza viruses
                 were distinct among their subtypes and different from those of
                 avian viruses. Newly isolated viruses could be added to the CA
                 results, creating a tool to investigate the host origin and
                 evolution of viral genes. It was found that the 1918 pandemic
                 H1N1 virus contained genes with mammalian-like viral codon
                 usage patterns, indicating that the introduction of this virus
                 to humans was not through in toto transfer of an avian
                 influenza virus.Many human viral genes had directional changes
                 in codon usage over time of viral isolation, indicating the
                 effect of host selection pressures. These changes reduced the
                 overall GC content and the usage of G at the third codon
                 position in the viral genome. Limited evidence of
                 translational selection pressure was found in a few viral
                 genes. CONCLUSIONS: Codon usage patterns from CA allowed
                 identification of host origin and evolutionary trends in
                 influenza viruses, providing an alternative method and a tool
                 to understand the evolution of influenza viruses. Human
                 influenza viruses are subject to selection pressure on codon
                 usage which might assist in understanding the characteristics
                 of newly emerging viruses.",

               as pandemic strains have originated from avian species. While
               most viruses are restricted to their primary hosts, zoonotic
               strains can sometimes arise from mutations or reassortment,
               leading them to acquire the capability to escape host species
               barrier and successfully infect a new host. Phylogenetic
               analyses and genetic markers are useful in tracing the origins
               of zoonotic infections, but there are still no effective means
               to identify high risk strains prior to an outbreak. Here we show

               identify possible zoonotic strains in avian species which have
               the potential to cause human infections. We have discovered that

               carry similar host tropism protein signatures characteristic of

  author   = "Eng, Christine L P and Tong, Joo Chuan and Tan, Tin Wee",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Majority of influenza A viruses reside and circulate
              among animal populations, seldom infecting humans due to host
              range restriction. Yet when some avian strains do acquire the
              ability to overcome species barrier, they might become adapted to
              humans, replicating efficiently and causing diseases, leading to
              potential pandemic. With the huge influenza A virus reservoir in
              wild birds, it is a cause for concern when a new influenza strain
              emerges with the ability to cross host species barrier, as shown
              in light of the recent H7N9 outbreak in China. Several influenza
              proteins have been shown to be major determinants in host
              tropism. Further understanding and determining host tropism would
              be important in identifying zoonotic influenza virus strains
              capable of crossing species barrier and infecting humans.
              RESULTS: In this study, computational models for 11 influenza
              proteins have been constructed using the machine learning
              algorithm random forest for prediction of host tropism. The
              prediction models were trained on influenza protein sequences
              isolated from both avian and human samples, which were
              transformed into amino acid physicochemical properties feature
              vectors. The results were highly accurate prediction models
              (ACC>96.57; AUC>0.980; MCC>0.916) capable of determining host
              tropism of individual influenza proteins. In addition, features
              from all 11 proteins were used to construct a combined model to
              predict host tropism of influenza virus strains. This would help
              assess a novel influenza strain's host range capability.
              CONCLUSIONS: From the prediction models constructed, all achieved
              high prediction performance, indicating clear distinctions in
              both avian and human proteins. When used together as a host
              tropism prediction system, zoonotic strains could potentially be
              identified based on different protein prediction results.
              Understanding and predicting host tropism of influenza proteins
              lay an important foundation for future work in constructing
              computation models capable of directly predicting interspecies
              transmission of influenza viruses. The models are available for

  abstract = "The recent explosion in the amount of available genome sequencing
              data imposes high computational demands on the tools designed to
              analyze it. Low-cost cloud computing has the potential to
              alleviate this burden. However, moving personal genome data
              analysis to the cloud raises serious privacy concerns. Read
              alignment is a critical and computationally intensive first step
              of most genomic data analysis pipelines. While significant effort
              has been dedicated to optimize the sensitivity and runtime
              efficiency of this step, few approaches have addressed
              outsourcing this computation securely to an untrusted party. The
              few secure solutions that have been proposed either do not scale
              to whole genome sequencing datasets or are not competitive with
              the state of the art in read mapping. In this paper, we present
              BALAUR, a privacy-preserving read mapping algorithm based on
              locality sensitive hashing and secure kmer voting. BALAUR
              securely outsources a significant portion of the computation to
              the public cloud by formulating the alignment task as a voting
              scheme between encrypted read and reference kmers. Our approach
              can easily handle typical genome-scale datasets and is highly
              competitive with non-cryptographic state-of-the-art read aligners
              in both accuracy and runtime performance on simulated and real
              read data. Moreover, our approach is significantly faster than
              state-of-the-art read aligners in long read mapping.",

                 high error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate
                 assembly of large repeats and closely related haplotypes
                 remains challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a
                 successor of Celera Assembler that is specifically designed
                 for noisy single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support
                 for nanopore sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage
                 requirements, and improves assembly continuity while
                 simultaneously reducing runtime by an order of magnitude on
                 large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2. These advances
                 result from new overlapping and assembly algorithms, including
                 an adaptive overlapping strategy based on tf-idf weighted

  abstract      = "Current deep learning architectures are growing larger in
                   order to learn from complex datasets. These architectures
                   require giant matrix multiplication operations to train
                   millions of parameters. Conversely, there is another growing
                   trend to bring deep learning to low-power, embedded devices.
                   The matrix operations, associated with both training and
                   testing of deep networks, are very expensive from a
                   computational and energy standpoint. We present a novel
                   hashing based technique to drastically reduce the amount of
                   computation needed to train and test deep networks. Our
                   approach combines recent ideas from adaptive dropouts and
                   randomized hashing for maximum inner product search to
                   select the nodes with the highest activation efficiently.
                   Our new algorithm for deep learning reduces the overall
                   computational cost of forward and back-propagation by
                   operating on significantly fewer (sparse) nodes. As a
                   consequence, our algorithm uses only 5\% of the total
                   multiplications, while keeping on average within 1\% of the
                   accuracy of the original model. A unique property of the
                   proposed hashing based back-propagation is that the updates
                   are always sparse. Due to the sparse gradient updates, our
                   algorithm is ideally suited for asynchronous and parallel
                   training leading to near linear speedup with increasing
                   number of cores. We demonstrate the scalability and
                   sustainability (energy efficiency) of our proposed algorithm
                   via rigorous experimental evaluations on several real
                   datasets.",

  abstract = "Enormous databases of short-read RNA-seq sequencing experiments
              such as the NIH Sequence Read Archive (SRA) are now available.
              However, these collections remain difficult to use due to the
              inability to search for a particular expressed sequence. A
              natural question is which of these experiments contain sequences
              that indicate the expression of a particular sequence such as a
              gene isoform, lncRNA, or uORF. However, at present this is a
              computationally demanding question at the scale of these
              databases. We introduce an indexing scheme, the Sequence Bloom
              Tree (SBT), to support sequence-based querying of terabase-scale
              collections of thousands of short-read sequencing experiments. We
              apply SBT to the problem of finding conditions under which query
              transcripts are expressed. Our experiments are conducted on a set
              of 2652 publicly available RNA-seq experiments contained in the
              NIH for the breast, blood, and brain tissues, comprising 5
              terabytes of sequence. SBTs of this size can be queried for a
              1000 nt sequence in 19 minutes using less than 300 MB of RAM,
              over 100 times faster than standard usage of SRA-BLAST and 119
              times faster than STAR. SBTs allow for fast identification of
              experiments with expressed novel isoforms, even if these isoforms
              were unknown at the time the SBT was built. We also provide some
              theoretical guidance about appropriate parameter selection in SBT
              and propose a sampling-based scheme for potentially scaling SBT
              to even larger collections of files. While SBT can handle any set
              of reads, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SBT by searching a
              large collection of blood, brain, and breast RNA-seq files for
              all 214,293 known human transcripts to identify tissue-specific

               structure for representing a set in order to support membership
               queries. Bloom filters allow false positives but the space
               savings often outweigh this drawback when the probability of an
               error is controlled. Bloom filters have been used in database
               applications since the 1970s, but only in recent years have they
               become popular in the networking literature. The aim of this
               paper is to survey the ways in which Bloom filters have been
               used and modified in a variety of network problems, with the aim
               of providing a unified mathematical and practical framework for
               understanding them and stimulating their use in future

              become the minimum element of the image of X under $\pi$. Our
              research was motivated by the fact that such a family (under some

              the AltaVista web index software to detect and filter
